<h4>
  1) Freshen up right. I know, with online school you’d rather wake up 10 minutes before class 
  with a bedhead just because you can, but taking some time to freshen up in the mornings and eat
  right will make a difference in your concentration later on! </h4>
  
 <h4> 2) Take notes! In our personal experience, taking down notes keeps you attentive to the important information your teacher
   is saying, and it’s harder to get distracted when you have something to focus on!</h4>
   
 <h4> 3)Get rid of distractions. That means putting your phone to charge in another room so you don’t get tempted to pick it 
  up during class!! Install a distraction blocker on your device if you need to, with adjustable block times. Allow yourself to freely 
  indulge in distractions during your break and lunchtimes, so you have something to look forward to!
