          Joining Meetings
        </h1>
        <h3>
          1) After opening the Zoom application on your desktop, you should see 4
          boxes labeled ‘New Meeting’, ‘Join’, ‘Schedule’, and ‘Share Screen’.
          Click on the top-right box labeled ‘Join’.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          2) Now two text boxes will appear to you. The first one is where you
          will type in your Meeting ID, this is the unique numeric code that
          your Zoom meeting room is assigned to. (If you do not know what your
          meeting code is, ask your teacher again! They may have forgotten to
          provide it.)
        </h3>

        <h3>
          3) Alternatively, you can press the small down arrow next to this
          textbox to view and select a meeting room from your recent Zoom call
          history, without having to type in the meeting code again. On the
          textbox below this, you can type in or edit your display name. Make
          sure you use your real name, so your teacher knows who you are and can
          let you in the meeting room!
        </h3>
        <h3>
          4) There are two checkboxes below, this is where you can choose not to
          connect to audio, or to turn off your video. But don’t worry, you can
          change these settings again once you’re in the call too. Press the
          blue ‘Join’ button and wait to be let in!
